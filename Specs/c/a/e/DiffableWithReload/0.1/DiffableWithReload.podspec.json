  "description": "iOS 13.0 introduced new diffable data source that can be used with UITableView and UICollectionView. Table/Collection view is updated by\napplying a snapshot containing section and items identifiers, thus easily allows insertion/removal/move of sections and items.\nCell reload is also supported, however it is fully on the developer to identify the items that need reload and add these items\nto the snapshot that will be applied.\n\nThis pod subclasses UITableViewDiffableDataSource and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and automates identification of the items\nthat need reload. So, you do not need to care about item reload at all. This subclasseddata source does it for you.",
